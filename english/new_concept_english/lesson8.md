# The best and the worst

## Article
Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for "The Nicest Garden Competition" each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. `He works harder than Joe`$^{[1]}$, and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. He `has made` neat paths and `has built` a wooden bridge over a pool$^{[2]}$. I also like gardens, but I don't like hard work. I enter for garden competition too every year, and I always wins a little prize `for the worst garden in the town`$^{[3]}$.
