# Not for jazz

## Article
We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. The clavichord is kept in the living room. It has belonged to our family for a long time. It was bought by my grandfather many years ago. Recently it was damaged by a visitor. She tried to play jazz on it. She struct the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken. My father was shocked. we are not allowed to touch it now. The instrument is being repaired by a friend of my father's.
