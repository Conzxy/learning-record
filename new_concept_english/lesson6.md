# Percy Buttons

## Article
I `have just move` to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He `asked` me `for` a meal and a glass of beer. `In return for this`, the beggar `stood on his head` and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me aboud him. Everybody knows hime. His name is Percy Buttons. He `calls` at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.
