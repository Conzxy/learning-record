# Too late
## Article
The plane was late and detectives were waiting$^{[1]}$ at the airport all morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds$^{[2]}$ from South Africa. A few hour earlier$^{[3]}$, someone had told$^{[4]}$ the police that thieves try to steal diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, and two others opended the parcel. To their suprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand!
